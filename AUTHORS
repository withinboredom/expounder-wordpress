Expounder was an idea I had originally conceived when reading tutorials, and
noticed that some interactivity in what I read would lead to a much more
interesting and efficient result. Stelios coded the initial prototype in a few
hours and Expounder was born.

This is an inevitably incomplete list of contributors to whom I am very grateful
for their help:

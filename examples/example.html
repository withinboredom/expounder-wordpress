		<p>This is a demo for the Expounder <span data-expounder="1">concept</span>. <span data-expounded="1">A concept is an experimental model that is designed to test
		viability of a product. </span> Expounder is meant to be implemented in tutorials and other explanatory texts, where there are readers of disparate <span data-expounder="2">levels of experience</span> on the topic. <span data-expounded="2">Levels of experience are when someone knows more things than someone else.</span></p>

		<p>If a reader needs clarification on a term, clicking the link will expand a piece of text, image or <span data-expounder="4">other elements</span>. Elements can also be <span data-expounder="5">infinitely nested</span> <span data-expounded="5">(i.e.  elements can contain <span data-expounder="6">other elements </span><span data-expounded="6">like this</span>)</span>.</p>

		<div data-expounded="4"><div class="highlight"><pre>a_piece_of(code)</pre></div></div>

		<p>If required, expounder links can be collapsible, like <span data-expounder-c="7">this guy right here</span>.<p>

		<p data-expounded="7">This content can be collapsed by clicking on the link again.</p>

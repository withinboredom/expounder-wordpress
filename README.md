# Expounder

Expounder is a small JS library that implements a concept I had for adaptable
experience levels in educational texts. In more concrete terms, expounder allows
authors of tutorials to hide their explanations if they expect readers to be
familiar with a concept. The author can choose to add a link to the concept,
which will appear underlined, and the reader can click on it to expand the next
few sentences, paragraph or any other element that explains the concept.

This way, people familiar with a term don't need to spend a paragraph reading
about it or waste time (and potentially miss other useful information) skimming
ahead. You can see an example in the `examples` directory, on the [Expounder
page](https://skorokithakis.github.io/expounder/) or on [one of my
posts](https://www.stavros.io/posts/building-cheap-home-sensorcontroller/).

Here's a demo GIF, from the Expounder page:

## Usage

Expounder.js can be added to your site in two simple steps:

<ol>
<li>Download and include <code>expounder.js</code> and <code>expounder.css</code> (or the minified
   version, for production) in your page. Alternatively, just add these two
   lines to your HTML:
<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/skorokithakis/expounder@master/expounder.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/skorokithakis/expounder@master/expounder.css" /></code></pre>
   </li>
   <li>
   Add <code>data-expounder</code>with arbitrary IDs for <code>span</code> elements that will act
   as hooks that expand areas, and <code>data-expounded</code> for the areas to be expanded.
   </li>
</ol>

For example:

```html
In the land of Mordor, in the fires of <span data-expounder="mount-doom">Mount
Doom</span>, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret, a master ring, to control
all others.

<div data-expounded="mount-doom">Mount Doom is that big-ass mountain over there
with the fires coming out of it.</div>
````

If you want the links to be collapsible again after they've been clicked, you can
include the script with `data-default-collapse="true"` in the `script` tag (see
the `examples/` dir for usage), though this is discouraged for usability.
